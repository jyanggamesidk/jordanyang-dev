    passage: `Astronomers noticed an eccentricity in the orbit of the planet Mercury which could not be explained by Newton's theory: the perihelion of the orbit was increasing by about 42.98 arcseconds per century. The most obvious explanation for this discrepancy was an as-yet-undiscovered celestial body, such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury, but all efforts to find such a body turned out to be fruitless. In 1915, Albert Einstein developed a theory of general relativity which was able to accurately model Mercury's orbit.`,
    question: `According to the text, what was the initial suspected cause of the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit?`,
    choices: {
      a: 'The presence of an undiscovered celestial body',
      b: 'An error in the measurement of the gravitational constant',
      c: 'A flaw in the theory of general relativity',
      d: 'A miscalculation of the distance between Mercury and the Sun'
    },
    solution: 'a'

    passage: `In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories in Asia and the Pacific, including Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, leading the United States to enter the war against the Axis. Japan conquered much of coastal China and Southeast Asia, but its advances in the Pacific were halted in June 1942 at the Battle of Midway.`,
    question: `The passage suggests that the turning point in the war against Japan occurred at which event?`,
    choices: {
      a: 'The invasion of Normandy',
      b: 'The Battle of Stalingrad',
      c: 'The Battle of Midway',
      d: 'The invasion of Italy'

    solution: 'c'
